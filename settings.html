        <h1>Settings</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>A proper configuration is the key to have this extension working securely!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Settings <strong>should be kept secret</strong> because they determine the way how passwords are
            pseudo-randomly generated. An attacker knowing your settings and able to predict your account 
            identifiers can get all your passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, if you copy these settings to another device you will have all your passwords
            also there.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this is the first time you use this extension take a few minutes to
            <button id="showInfo">read this</button> to understand how to configure and use it.

                <h2>Monkeys and bananas</h2>
                <p>
                    This password manager works by generating <strong>pseudo-random</strong> strings of characters
                    as password suggestions, similarly to having a monkey typing random keys on your keyboard. 
                    The comparison with a monkey is to explain complex stuff in simple terms (I also love monkeys).
                    You can read detailed and technical documentation <a href="https://github.com/leonixyz/YAPM">on 
                    this page</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The difference between a real-world monkey and this extension, is that this extension is able to behave 
                    deterministically, which means that our monkey always press the same sequence of keys
                    <strong>provided that it has been previously fed with the same food</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason we will feed the monkey in two steps: the first time secretly, the second time
                    (possibly but not necessarily) in front of other people. Having the monkey take the first part
                    of the meal in secret, allows us to care less what it will eat in front of other people, because
                    in the fist part of the meal we are establishing a <strong>secret</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, if we <strong>secretly feed</strong> our monkey with
                    <ol>
                        <li>three quarter of a banana,</li>
                        <li>two apples,</li>
                        <li>twentysix corn seeds,</li>
                    </ol>

                    and then we feed it again <strong>in front of other people</strong> with just a cookie, we can be pretty
                    sure that <strong>it will be extremely hard</strong> for someone else than ourselves guessing the 
                    complete monkey's lunch, and feed the monkey again, in the exact same way, to steal our password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, by feeding the monkey with just one corn seed more (or less) we will end up with a totally
                    different outcome. The result is strictly determined by the food the monkey gets, but each smallest
                    difference in the food will determine a truly random difference in the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This extension works as explained above, by providing you with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the monkey (the password-generation algorythm behind this extension)</li>
                        <li>a secret way to feed it (the configuration)</li>
                        <li>a way to feed it in front of other people (the user interface)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generated passwords will be automatically copied to your clipboard, you can paste them
                    where needed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="info">
                <h2>Seeds and identifiers</h2>
                <p>
                    On this page you have to configure the first, secret, most important part of the monkey's lunch 
                    (<strong>the cryptographic seed</strong>). You can use whatever value you like. Paranoids will 
                    paste here a random string taken from <a href="https://www.random.org/strings/">random.org</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all settings are done, you can copy the same configuration to other browsers, even to other
                    devices, and have your passwords everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To have a password generator, and not a circus show with monkeys, the "public lunch" is in turn
                    divided in two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>an account identifier</strong>: a string identifying for what account/service you need
                            the password, which is the monkey's food that anyone can see by looking at your screen while you're
                            using this extension
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>a master password</strong>: another string which cannot be read on the screen, but that
                            someone might be able to see, if you are not smart or fast enough, while you are typing it on 
                            the keyboard: it's like having the monkey eat something hidden in your pocket, but in front of other 
                            people
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <div style="background:white; padding:1em; display: inline-block;">

                    This is the initialization value for pseudo-randomness, you can use whatever string you like,
